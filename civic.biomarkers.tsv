ALK	238	DEL4-11	NA	Predictive	Supports	D: Preclinical evidence	The MYCN amplification positive relapsed neuroblastoma-derived cell line CLB-BAR contains the driver ALK DEL 11-14 mutation, which removes extracellular domain exons 4 through 11. Brigatinib treatment of CLB-BAR cells reduced MYCN protein levels and ALK phosphorylation (Y1604) similar to crizotnib. Brigatinib reduced CLB-BAR cellular proliferation more effectively than crizotinib (IC50 75.2 vs 186.4nM). CLB-BAR xenografts in BalbC/NUDE mice responded to brigatinib with reduced tumor volume and weight (N=8/group) as well as reduced ALK phosphorylation and MYCN levels compared to untreated controls. Release of brigatinib administration at day 15 resulted in tumor growth (N=2).

Predictive	Supports	C: Case study	BRAF mutations were identified in 9% of 108 cases of high-grade colorectal neuroendocrine tumors (80% V600E). Two patients were treated with a combination of BRAF and MEK inhibition and exhibited durable response (beyond 7 and 9 months, respectively). Urinary BRAF V600E tumor DNA correlated with disease response in one of the patients. BRAF and MEK inhibition was either dabrafenib+trametinib (case 1) or vemurafenib+trametinib (case 2).

One study that independently analyzed R882 and non-R882 mutations showed R882 mutations were associated with poorer prognosis than patients with wildtype and non-R882 mutations, but only in older patients with AML.

DNMT3A	1788	MUTATION	DNMT3A mutations occur in a variety of myeloid malignancies. These mutations are associated with adverse prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly in the context of NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations, which often co-occur. Early results indicate AML patients with DNMT3A mutations may respond better to decitabine than those with wild-type. Shorter survival has been indicated in patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, however, larger cohorts are required to verify this finding. DNMT3A mutations have been suggested as a pre-leukemic lesion and found in older individuals with clonal hematopoiesis but no overt malignancy.

EGFR	1956	T790M	EGFR T790M was one of the very first mutations recognized to confer resistance to targeted therapies in non-small cell lung cancer. While successful in amplified EGFR, the efficacy of the first and second generation TKI's (erlotinib, gefitinib, neratinib) in treating patients harboring this mutation before treatment is notably lower. This lack of efficacy can likely be to blame for the poorer prognosis for patients with this mutation as compared to patients with wildtype EGFR or other types of EGFR mutations. Approximately half of EGFR mutant tumors with acquired resistance to TKI inhibition have been shown to harbor this mutation, implicating it as a mechanism of acquired therapy resistence. A third generation TKI (osimertinib) has been approved for the treatment of EGFR T790M mutant NSCLC. Patients positive for T790M in a plasma-based test have similar outcomes like those with tumor biopsy testing.	Predictive	Supports	D: Preclinical evidence	Lung cancers can accumulate activating mutations in oncogenes such as EGFR. The common L858R EGFR mutation has been shown previously to be sensitive to small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ie. erlotinib). In response, tumors may accumulate an additional 'gatekeeper' mutation in EGFR, T790M. Authors show that T790M retain low affinity for gefitinib and that introduction of T790M in the presence of L858R mutant increases the ATP affinity of L858R and activates wild-type EGFR, thus showing that increased ATP affinity is the primary mode of resistance in tumors with T790M, though irreversible ATP inhibitors (ie. HKI-272) are able to overcome this resistance via covalent bonding.

Approximately half of EGFR mutant tumors with acquired resistance to TKI inhibition have been shown to harbor this mutation, implicating it as a mechanism of acquired therapy resistence. A third generation TKI (osimertinib) has been approved for the treatment of EGFR T790M mutant NSCLC. Patients positive for T790M in a plasma-based test have similar outcomes like those with tumor biopsy testing.	Predictive	Supports	B: Clinical evidence	This study summarized 9 EGFR-mutant patients from two clinical trials involving rociletinib (NCT01526928) and subsequent osimertinib (NCT01802632). 8 were T790M-positive prior to treatment with osimertinib. 6 transitioned directly from rociletinib to osimertinib. 3 patients achieved PR and 4 achieved SD. The median PFS was 208 days (95% CI, 41-208 days). Among 6 patients who transitioned directly from rociletinib to osimertinib all derived clinical benefit from osimertinib with either prolonged SD or PR.

Predictive	Supports	D: Preclinical evidence	In mice, human HER2 with YVMA insertion was placed under a doxycycline-inducible, clara cell specific promoter. Induction of mutant HER2 in these mice drove rapid development of adenosquamous lung tumors, where tumor maintenance was dependent on continued mutant HER2 induction by doxycycline.  It was found that treating these mice with afatinib and rapamycin had stronger effects than either treatment alone, including greater tumor regression and increased tumor necrosis.  The authors cite findings that HER2 activity in cancer may be highly dependent on its Akt/mTOR signaling arm as a possible explanation for this effect, and conclude that their results give rationale for testing of afatinib/rapamycin treatment in lung cancer.

ERBB2	2064	M774INSAYVM	Mutations in the HER2 kinase domain occur at a 2-4% frequency in lung adenocarcinomas, the majority of which are in exon 20 as in-frame duplications or insertions in a small 8 codon region (774-781 or 775-782). These are analogous to the exon 20 alterations found in EGFR TK domain. The M774 insertion, M774insAYVM, represents 62.5% of all HER2 kinase domain mutations identified (when combined with the A775insYVMA mutations as they translate to the identical amino acid sequence changes). As demonstrated in mouse models (Perrera et al., PNAS 2009) and subsequent clinical trials in human lung adenocarcinoma with these insertions, HER2 YVMA mutants predict response to several targeted HER2 agonists such as afatinib, trastuzumab, neratinib and TDM-1 (trastuzumab emtansine) as monotherapy or combined with specific chemotherapies.	Predictive	Supports	D: Preclinical evidence	Human HER2 with YVMA insertion was put under a clara cell specific, rtTA promoter system inducible via doxycycline.  Induction of mutant HER2 in these mice drove rapid development of adenosquamous lung tumors, where tumor maintenance was dependent on continued YMVA HER2 induction by doxycycline.  Administration of afatinib had a stronger effect than erlotinib or trastuzumab, as measured by histology and tumor volume regression.  Authors state that in the case of afatinib vs. trastuzumab, intracellular HER2 signaling may be blocked by afatanib but remain unaltered by trastuzumab.

It was thought that the wider range of ErbB family blocking and irreversible properties of afatinib could be beneficial in trastuzumab resistant cancer cells, since ErbB family members are thought to play a role in trastuzumab resistance. Primary endpoint was intention-to-treat group PFS. 339 patients were assigned to afatanib + vinorelbine and 169  to trastuzumab + vinorelbine.  Recruitment was stopped prematurely when it was deemed unlikely that the increased PFS would be seen in the afatinib group. Median PFS was 5.5 months in the afatinib group and 5.6 months in the trastuzumab group.  Afatanib plus vinorelbine was less well tolerated than trastuzumab plus vinorelbine, and the authors conclude that trastuzumab remains the best choice for treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 positive metastatic BC.

HER2 overexpression in USPC is more common in African American women.  This report covered 2 African American patients, the first of which presented high-grade endometrial adenocarcinoma with IHC3+ HER2-positivity as well as positivity by FISH.  Prior treatment involved surgery and chemotherapy.  Treatment with pacitaxel/carboplatin with trastuzumab showed clear clinical improvement assessed by CT scan and drop in CA-125 levels from 988 to 7.9 U/mL.  The second patient had USPC, and was treated with surgery and radiation.  Trastuzumab monotheraby was then administered.

ERBB2	2064	OVEREXPRESSION	NA	Predictive	Supports	A: Validated	ToGA, a Phase III study (NCT01041404) addressed use of trastuzumab in HER2 positive (overexpression or amplification) advanced gastric cancer, where chemotherapy using fluoropyrimidine-based and platinum-based combinations had been common practice.  Patients were given a chemotherapy regime containing capecitabine, flourouracil and cisplatin with (n=298) or without (n=296) trastuzumab, and had not been previously treated for metastatic cancer.  Study endpoint was overall survival, which was significantly different in the two populations (13.8 months with chemotherapy + trastuzumab and 11.1 months for chemotherapy alone).  The authors conclude that trastuzumab should be a standard option for HER2 positive advanced gastric cancer.

In this study using a panel of NSCLC HER2 overexpressing cell lines, antiproliferative effects of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) were observed in a HER2-expression dependant manner, with strongest effects in Calu-3 (high expressing) and no effects in Calu-6 (low expressing).  Trastuzumab did not show notable effects on cell growth in any tested cells.  HER2 positivity in NSCLC is fairly common at 2-20%.  A clinical trial (NCT02289833) is currently underway to asses TDM-1 in HER2 overexpressing lung cancer.

ERBB2	2064	AMPLIFICATION	Her2 (ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered. Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.	Predictive	Does Not Support	B: Clinical evidence	This phase II single arm study assessed trastuzumab monotherapy in HER2 positive endometrial cancers with tumor response as primary endpoint.  Participants had stage III, IV or recurrent HER2 positive endometrial cancer.  During the trial's initial phase, 23 of 132 patients screened met the criteria of IHC2+ or 3+ or FISH positivity for HER2 status.  In the absence of results, the trial entered phase B, where only patients with HER2 amplification by FISH were admitted.  The trial ended early due to poor accrual with 11 of 154 screened meeting the phase B criteria. No major objective tumor responses were observed in the study.  28% of the cancers were of the serous type that had shown trastuzumab response in case studies.  The investigators note that in other HER2 cancers, such as breast and gastrointestinal, trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy has been found most effective, and could warrant more study.  Currently a clinical trial (NCT01367002) is evaluating carboplatin/paclitaxel with or without trastuzumab in uterine serous cancer.

At the first planned interim analysis, trastuzumab treatment for one year was compared with observation alone.  A significant difference in disease-free survival was seen with 220 DFS events out of 1693 in the observation arm versus 127 DFS events out of 1694 in the 1 year trastuzumab arm.  1 year adjuvant trastuzumab is currently the standard of care.

Patients were required to have progressed on or after treatments involving trastuzumab and a taxane, and no prior exposure to lapatinib or T-DM1.   Primary endpoints included independently assessed progression free survival (PFS) and safety. PFS was 9.6 months in T-DM1 group vs. 6.4 months in lapatinib plus capecitabine.  Rates of adverse events of grade 3 or higher were greater with lapatinib plus capecitabine.  These results, together with other trials such as TH3RESA indicate promise for T-DM1 therapy in HER2 amplification, and this will be further studied in an arm of the NCI-MATCH trial.

The irreversible TKI afatinib blocks EGFR, HER2, ErbB3 and ErbB4.  Thus afatinib was studied in this Phase I trial of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 positive metastatic BC (MBC) in combination with continued trastuzumab treatment, where trastuzumab is still the perferred treatment for trastuzumab-progressed MBC.  Objective response and disease control rates were 11% and 39%.

The results are in contrast to the principle of change of treatment on disease progression, and authors suggest that chemotherapy-sensitizing mechanisms of trastuzumab remain intact in HER2 breast cancer cells with trastuzumab progression.

ERBB2	2064	AMPLIFICATION	Her2 (ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered. Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.	Predictive	Supports	B: Clinical evidence	The Phase III trial, TH3RESA (NCT01419197), was performed in patients with advanced HER2 breast cancer that was heavily pretreated.  Patients were required to have prior exposure to trastuzumab and lapatinib as well as a taxane.  This patient population has not seen many studies, responds poorly to late-line treatment with trastuzumab, and in this study was treated with trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1, n=404) vs. physician's choice (usually trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, n=198).  Results showed progression free survival was 6.2 months in T-DM1 treatment vs. 3.3 months under physician's choice, along with lower incidence of grade 3 or worse events with T-DM1.  The authors conclude that their findings in this heavily pretreated population, along with findings in the EMILIA trial, indicate promise for antibody-drug conjugates.

MMTV-NeuT mice were crossed with floxed p110alpha mice. Diassacociated tumors cells from these mice were treated with Cre adenovirus to delete p110alpha, or GFP adenovirus, and cells were transplanted into athymic mice.

Next, MMTV-NeuT tumors were dissociated and treated with pan-PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941. Reduced lipid kinase activity and reduced phospho-Akt levels were seen in these cells. Administration of 125 mg/kg GDC-0941 to athymic mice with transplantation of tumor cells caused marked reduction of tumor cell volume in comparison to control treatment.

Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.	Prognostic	Supports	B: Clinical evidence	In a study of 27 African American and caucasian patients, endometrial adenocarcinoma samples were assessed for HER2 via IHC staining, and association studies were performed using corresponding patient information.  Earlier deaths were seen with heavier HER2 expression.  Multivariate Cox regression indicated that shorter survival was associated with higher HER2 expression, and not with age or ethnicity, and that observed differences in survival rates between ethnicities can be ascribed to higher rates of HER2 overexpression in African American patients.  The authors conclude that high HER2 expression in USPC is associated with poor outcome and explains observed differences in outcome between ethnicities.

FLT3	2322	ITD	FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplications) frequently occur in patients with hematologic malignancies such as chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome, but particularly in cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). These duplication events disrupt the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 and can be the result of a duplication of internal FLT3 sequence or other unrelated sequence resulting in an in-frame duplication event. The length of these duplications can vary widely which may have prognostic consequences, but this has not been conclusively determined.

Mutations at 3 AL residues (D835 [n = 31], D839 [n = 3], and Y842 [n = 16]), with varying degrees of resistance to ponatinib were identified. FLT3 D835 mutations were shown to confer resistance to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor AC220 and ponatinib.

SU5614 resistance mutations were limited to exchanges in the second part of the kinase domain (TK2), with exchanges of D835 predominating (D835E were most common). In clones that emerged at 1,500 nmol/L SU5614 after ENU (mutagen) treatment, 127 of 179 clones (71%) displayed mutations, generating 9 different exchanges affecting 6 positions in the activation loop of FLT3.

Mutations at three of these amino acid positions conferred high degrees of in vitro AC220 resistance (based on proliferation and cell-based biochemical assays). Among these residues, two within the activation loop were found (D835, Y842). 
Pre-treatment and relapse samples of 8 patients (treated with AC220) with FLT3-ITD+ acute myeloid leukemia were analyzed. The activation loop mutation D835Y was detected in three cases, D835V in two, and D835F was identified in a single patient. Cross-resistance to sorafenib was identified in-vitro.

KRAS	3845	G13D	While the KRAS G13 region is a widely studied recurrent region in cancer, its impact on clinical action is still debated. Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G12 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib.

KRAS	3845	MUTATION	NA	Predictive	Supports	D: Preclinical evidence	CDK1 was identified in a preclinical siRNA screen to identify targets in KRAS mutant tumors. Cell viability was evaluated following knockdown of 834 genes in isogenic LIM1215 colorectal cancer cell lines harboring wildtype (parental), G12S, G12D or G12V KRAS. 6 targets identified by this screen were evaluated in a second set of isogenic colorectal cancer cell lines (SW48) harboring wildtype (parental), G12S, G12D, G12V or G13D KRAS where only CDK1 knockdown more profoundly reduced survival in mutant cells compared to wildtype. Results were validated in 5 KRAS mutant (BRAF WT) and 10 KRAS WT colorectal cancer cell lines. Chemical inhibition of CDK1 by AZD5438 in KRAS mutant vs WT pancreatic and colorectal cancer cell lines showed increased efficacy in mutant cell lines. Finally, AZD5438 reduced tumor growth induced by SW620 (KRAS p.G12V) colorectal tumour cells xenografted into immunodeficient mice.

KRAS	3845	MUTATION	NA	Predictive	Supports	D: Preclinical evidence	Preclinical study analyzing the differential response to MEK Inhibitors in KRAS and BRAF mutant cancer cell lines and mouse xenografts. Efficacy of MEK inhibitors (GDC-0623 and G-573) in KRAS-driven tumours is mediated by a hydrogen-bond interaction with S212 in MEK that is critical for blocking MEK feedback phosphorylation by wild-type RAF. This mechanism was distinct from GDC-0973 which is less potent in KRAS mutant tumors. Overall, this work indicates that MEK inhibitors with this mechanism of action will be most effective in patients with both BRAF and KRAS mutations.

Persistence of NPM1-mutated transcripts in blood was present in 15% of the patients after the second chemotherapy cycle. This persistence was associated with a greater risk of relapse after 3 years of follow-up than was an absence of such transcripts (82% vs. 30%; hazard ratio, 4.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.95 to 7.80; P<0.001) and a lower rate of survival (24% vs. 75%; hazard ratio for death, 4.38; 95% CI, 2.57 to 7.47; P<0.001). The presence of minimal residual disease was the only independent prognostic factor for death in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 4.84; 95% CI, 2.57 to 9.15; P<0.001).

E545K, and possibly the other mutations in the E545 region, may present patients with a poorer prognosis than patients with either patients with other PIK3CA variant or wild-type PIK3CA. There is also data to suggest that E545/542 mutations may confer resistance to EGFR inhibitors like cetuximab. While very prevalent, targeted therapies for variants in PIK3CA are still in early clinical trial phases.	Predictive	Supports	D: Preclinical evidence	HCC827 cell lines harboring activated PI3K (HCC827 p110α E545K cells) were more resistant to gefitinib in vitro (IC50, 1 μM) compared with those harboring GFP alone (IC50, 0.01 μM). The presence of p110α E545K also protected HCC827 cells from gefitinib-mediated apoptosis.

Inhibitor concentrations for 50% survival fraction (SF50) were measured and SF50 less than one micro molar was considered sensitive. PIK3CA mutant cell lines were significantly more sensitive to both everolimus and PP242 than PIK3CA wild type cell lines. Apoptotic indicators and cell cycle analysis indicated that the mTOR inhibitors induced G1 arrest instead of apoptosis in the cell lines.

In the BOLERO trials, patients with HER2-overexpressing advanced breast cancer were treated with trastuzumab, chemotherapy and randomized to receive either everolimus or placebo. In the pooled analysis of both trials, patients with PI3K mutations had longer progression-free survival with everolimus compared to placebo (HR 0.67 95%CI 0.45 to 1.00, P=0.05) whereas patients with PI3K wild type status did not benefit significantly (HR 1.1, 95%CI 0.83 to 1.46, P=0.5). The same was found when PI3K mutations, PTEN loss and AKT E17K mutations were combinedly analyzed as hyperactive PI3K pathway. Patients with PI3K hyperactive pathway had a hazard ratio of 0.67 (95%CI 0.48 to 0.93, P=0.02) compared to HR 1.19 (95%CI 0.87 to 1.62, P=0.28) in patients with PI3K normal pathway.

In the BOLERO trials, patients with HER2-overexpressing advanced breast cancer were treated with trastuzumab, chemotherapy and randomized to receive either everolimus or placebo. In the pooled analysis of both trials, patients with PTEN loss (as defined by IHC staining intensity and proportion of positive tumor cells) had a longer progression-free survival with everolimus compared to placebo (HR 0.54 (95%CI 0.31 to 0.96, P=0.04) whereas patients with PTEN normal status had a hazard ration of 1.00 (95%CI 0.8 to 1.26, P=0.97).
The same was found when PI3K mutations, PTEN loss and AKT E17K mutations were combined and analyzed as hyperactive PI3K pathway. Patients with PI3K hyperactive pathway had a hazard ratio of 0.67 (95%CI 0.48 to 0.93, P=0.02) compared to HR 1.19 (95%CI 0.87 to 1.62, P=0.28) in patients with PI3K normal pathway.

PTEN	5728	LOSS	NA	Predictive	Supports	D: Preclinical evidence	Knockdown of PTEN in trastuzumab sensitive HER2 breast cancer BT474 cells induced trastuzumab resistance. PTEN null cells treated with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 also did not show substantial inhibition, but co-treatment with trastuzumab and LY294002 induced growth inhibition comparable to trastuzumab alone in normal BT474 cells. BT474 mouse xenograft tumors were injected with PTEN antisense (AS) oligonucleotides and this resulted in trastuzumab resitance. Co-treatment of PTEN AS tumor mice with LY294002 and trastuzumab inhibited tumor growth in comparison to PTEN AS tumors treated with trastuzumab or LY294002 alone.

This paper reports functional studies of this variant. Mouse models with this variant show an increase in spontaneous tumor formation. 16 out of 20 (80%) of S47 homozygous mice developed cancer between 12 and 18 months of age. Cancers predominantly included hepatocellular carcinoma, B-cell lymphoma, and histiocytic sarcoma, as well as other
tumor types. In S47/wild-type heterozygote mice an increased cancer incidence, with a predisposition for hepatocellular carcinoma, was also found. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human lymphoblastoid cell lines with S47 mutations were significantly less sensitive to cisplatinum treatment compared to TP53 wild-type cells (apoptosis and viability).

This was mediated by wild-type TP53-induced cell-arrest under chemotherapy even in the context of heterozygous TP53 point mutations or absence of p21. Thus the status of both TP53 alleles should be assessed because even one copy of wild-type TP53 may contribute to poor response to chemotherapy.

Methylome analysis revealed three CpG clusters (C1–3) with differential methylation to be negatively correlated with differential c-MET mRNA expression. In nearly all (90%) pairwise comparisons of tumors and cell lines, differential c-MET mRNA expression could be accounted for by at least one differential CpG cluster methylation (Δβ ≥ 10% and FDR adjusted p ≤ 0.05). In contrast, only 48% displayed a concordant differential expression pattern of at least one c-MET transcription factor. In an independent study, c-MET was overexpressed in 8 of 35 (23%) MAPKi-resistant tumors from 7 of 26 (27%) patients.

Combined EGFR and BRAF inhibition (panitumumab and vemurafenib) showed an initial partial response for 4 months. Re-biopsy at the time of progression showed a MET amplification and overexpression (IHC, ISH) but no secondary mutations in candidate resistance genes (EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, MAP2K1). MET amplification was also present in a subset of tumor cells in the pretreatment sample. MET amplification was also identified in 3/17 (18%) chemonaive BRAF V600E colorectal cancer tumor tissues.
Overexpression of MET in a BRAF mutant CRC cell line (WiDr) confered resistance to combined vemurafenib and panitumumab. The addition of crizotinib to this combination restored sensitivity in vitro.
The patient was started on combined vemurafenib and crizotinib in January 2016 and had a metabolic, clinical and tumor marker response that was ongoing at the time of publication (06/16) without significant toxicity.

AREG	374	EXPRESSION	NA	Predictive	Supports	B: Clinical evidence	47 HNSCC patients treated with cetuximab/docetaxel were retrospectively analyzed for EGFRvIII, EGFR and AREG expression with IHC. 45% of cases expressed high level of AREG. High AREG expression in tumor cells was associated with reduced overall survival  (hazard ratio: 2.2, P = 0.002) and progression free survival (hazard ratio: 2.2, P = 0.016) compared to patients with low AREG expression score. AREG was an independent prognosticator of OS in multivariate Cox analysis. High EGFRvIII and AREG expression levels identified SCCHN (squamous cell carcinoma, head and neck) patients that were less likely to benefit from combination treatment with cetuximab and docetaxel.

A synthetic lethal screen using a total of 3,530 shRNAs to target 518 human kinases identified ERBB3 knockdown to confer sensitivity of selumetinib-resistant H358 cells (NSCLC cell line) to the MEK inhibitor selumetinib. The dual EGFR-ERBB2 inhibitors afatinib and dacomitinib each showed synergy with MEK Inhibition via selumetinib in 4 KRAS mutant cell lines. Western blot evaluation of 9 NSCLC and 12 CRC cell lines showed ERBB3 expression correlated with the synergy score for combination afatinib and trametinib treatment. I.e. the synergy score was low in cells having low basal levels of ERBB3 protein and high for cells having high basal ERBB3 expression. Using selumetinib in patient-derived CRC xenografts or trametinib in NSCLC xenografts, MEK inhibition by selumetinib or trametinib in combination with afatinib more effectively inhibited increases in tumor volume than either monotherapy.

A FGFR1 N546K mutation was detected in one patient. Gain of the FGFR1 locus (qPCR) was observed in 13 of 41 patients (31.7%) and Ewing sarcoma cell lines (A673, CADO, SK-NMC, SK-ES, and VH-64). FGFR1 was also highly expressed in Ewing sarcoma (mRNA and IHC) and correlated with copy number. Retroviral transduction of FGFR1 wild-type or the FGFR1 N546K mutant into NIH3T3 cells led to enhanced proliferation especially for cells harboring the FGFR1 mutation. ShRNA mediated knockdown of FGFR1 inhibited growth of Ewing sarcoma and other cancer cells (A549 lung carcinoma cell line or leukemia cell lines HL60 and Kasumi) with almost complete growth suppression only in the Ewing sarcoma cell lines and knockdown of FGFR1 abrogated growth of cell lines in xenograft.

A FGFR1 N546K mutation was detected in one patient. Gain of the FGFR1 locus (qPCR) was observed in 13 of 41 patients (31.7%) and Ewing sarcoma cell lines (A673, CADO, SK-NMC, SK-ES, and VH-64). FGFR1 was also highly expressed in Ewing sarcoma (mRNA and IHC) and correlated with copy number. Retroviral transduction of FGFR1 wild-type or the FGFR1 N546K mutant into NIH3T3 cells led to enhanced proliferation especially for cells harboring the FGFR1 mutation. ShRNA mediated knockdown of FGFR1 inhibited growth of Ewing sarcoma and other cancer cells (A549 lung carcinoma cell line or leukemia cell lines HL60 and Kasumi) with almost complete growth suppression only in the Ewing sarcoma cell lines and knockdown of FGFR1 abrogated growth of cell lines in xenograft.

In-vitro experiments confirmed that FOXP3 expression enhance anthracycline efficacy. The in vitro data consisted of testing the sensitivity of various breast cancer cell lines to anthracyclines after treatment with valproic acid (which increases FOXP3 expression).

MIR218-1	407000	EXPRESSION	NA	Prognostic	Supports	B: Clinical evidence	Researchers examined the prognostic role of miR-218 expression in CRC tumor samples when receiving 5-FU based treatment. CRC samples from patients who received first-line 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy were stratified into two groups (complete/partial response and stable/progressive disease) based on RECIST criteria. miR-218 expression levels were found to be significantly higher in the complete/partial response group.  Further Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that in groups with higher miR-218 expression, overall survival was significantly greater.
